## Description

A makefile for packaging the `glob` and `fnmatch` Python modules as a SIS file.

The `glob` and `fnmatch` modules are commonly required by Python scripts, yet these modules are not included in PyS60 1.4.5. You may use a SIS file to install them separately as required, or embed the SIS as part of your application installation package.

## Download

For a pre-built self-signed SIS file see the [downloads page](http://new.contextlogger.org/fnmatch-python/download/).
